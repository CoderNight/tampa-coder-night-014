Coder Night June 2014

Our programming challenge this month won't be from our typical puzzlenode.com selection, but instead we will write a program to solve 'The Tower of Hanoi' -- you can read about the puzzle here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi


Your program should accept a number of disks, and generate an output that moves a stack of that many disks from peg #1 to peg #3 -- You may use any output form you like. The adventurous could do an animation -- but simply a text list of disk moves would be fine.
