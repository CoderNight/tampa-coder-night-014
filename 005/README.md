==Original intent

Make a service discovery app in go to provide towers for solving the towers of hanoi

==What's here

I only have the solution to towers of hanoi + a simple connection handler

==Future steps

I'll be making a youtube on how to use serf to solve the towers of hanoi.
For now, you can at least see what the non-networked solution is like.


=Running

copy "hanoi_serfer" to your $GOPATH
run with:
```
go run hanoi_server.go $NUM_OF_DISKS
```
